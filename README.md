# ft_ls

This project is a custom implementation of the `ls` command, replicating a subset of its functionality.

Developed in the `C programming language`, it serves as a reimplementation of the `ls` tool commonly used in Bash. The project demonstrates foundational programming concepts and explores system-level interactions in Unix-like environments.
